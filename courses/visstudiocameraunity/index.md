## Visualization Spaces Development Kit

This course is designed to be an introduction to using a specialized camera system made for the Unity development environment for use in the Visualization Spaces at North Carolina State University; those being the [Cyma Rubin Visualization Gallery](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/spaces/visualization-studio) at D. H. Hill Jr. Library and the [Teaching and Visualization Lab](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/spaces/teaching-and-visualization-lab) at James B. Hunt Jr. Library.

### New to Unity?

Please note that this is not an introduction to Unity. To follow along with this course, we assume that you already have a fundamental understanding of using the Unity environment. If you are new to Unity, please consider looking at [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/) and follow the [Unity Essentials Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials) as it contains guided learning experiences that will help you understand the basics of Unity. Referencing the direct [Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) can also provide further information and assistance if needed.

### Camera Options

There are two camera system options available, one for a 3D environment and the other for a 2D environment. There is also an emulator for the Visualization Gallery that can be used to test to see how a project will look without having to be in the space. Select the option below “Select Camera” that best suits your purposes and follow the instructions given within.

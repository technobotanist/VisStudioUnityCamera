### New to Unreal?

Please note that this is not an introduction to Unreal Engine. To follow along with this course, we assume that you already have a fundamental understanding of using the Unreal environment. If you are new to Unreal, please consider looking at [Unreal Engine’s Learning Resources](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/learn) to familiarize yourself with engine basics. Referencing the [Official Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/) acan also provide further information and assistance if needed.

### Before You Begin

Before anything else, you will need a new or existing Unreal Engine project to prepare for use in the Visualization Studio. For Unreal Engine 4, projects should use engine version 4.26 or later (the same steps should work for earlier versions, but no testing has been done prior to 4.26). For Unreal Engine 5, any version will do (at the time of writing).

To prepare your project for the Visualization Studio, follow along with the walkthrough video (link below), and reference the notes if/when needed.

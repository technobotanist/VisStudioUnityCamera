# Visualization Studio Development Kit

In order to make the Visualization Studio more accessible to the faculty, students, and staff at NC State, this course has been created to explain how to use the Visualization Studio with the Unity and Unreal Engines. The courses cover a wide array of topics, from creating custom C++ classes in the Unreal Engine, to working with the space in 2D and 3D, to working with a custom emulator that can be used within the Unity Engine. We hope you enjoy the courses.

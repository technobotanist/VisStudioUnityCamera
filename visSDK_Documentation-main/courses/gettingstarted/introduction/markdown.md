While the use of GitCourseware does not require any knowledge of HTML or programming, all of our content pages are created using the [Markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Like HTML, Markdown is a "markup language", meaning it's used to annotate text content so that a web browser or application knows how to display it. If you are old enough to remember WordPerfect 5.1 and the "Reveal Codes" functionality, it's basically the same thing...

Markdown is incredibly easy to learn. A [simple cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is a good reference for how to write in Markdown. In your text editor, you simply need to annotate selected text the way you want it. For example, if you want **Bold Text**, you would enter `**Bold Text**` into your text editor.

There are also numerous WYSIWYG tools available for Markdown, discussed on the next page. You should familiarize yourself with Markdown as you build your course.
